# Graphing Calculator

This is a simple web-based graphing calculator that allows you to plot and compare two mathematical expressions. You can also calculate the area between the curves generated by these expressions.

## How to Use

1. Enter your first mathematical expression in the "Enter Equation 1" input field. For example, you can input expressions like `sin(x)`, `x^2 + 2x - 1`, etc.

2. Enter your second mathematical expression in the "Enter Equation 2" input field.

3. Select the plot type you want from the "Plot Type" dropdown. You can choose between "Curve" and "Area."

4. Click the "Plot" button to visualize the graphs of both expressions on the canvas.

5. If you selected "Area" as the plot type, you can click the "Calculate Area" button to find the area between the curves.

## Styling and Responsiveness

The calculator is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. It provides a clean and user-friendly interface. The graphs are plotted using the Chart.js library, and mathematical evaluations are performed using the Math.js library.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 and CSS3 for the user interface
- JavaScript for interactive functionality
- Chart.js for graph plotting
- Math.js for mathematical evaluations

Feel free to use and customize this graphing calculator for your own needs. Enjoy exploring and comparing mathematical functions!
